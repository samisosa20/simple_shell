.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is a simple command interpreter for the system.
.SS Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the
terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and
has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both
interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).
That is, commands
can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and
the file can be executed directly by the shell.
.SS Syntax
When using this shell, the syntax for running any command 
follows the familiar syntax when running a command in any 
other shell:
.br
.B $ <command> <flags or options> <argument 1> <argument 2> ...
